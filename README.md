# MLB Predict

MLB Predict is a free game where users can pick the result of an upcoming at bat in any MLB game to earn points and compete against friends and the public.

## How To Play

1. Visit the [home page](https://mlb-predict-19054.firebaseapp.com) to get started.
2. Select any MLB game scheduled for today.
3. Log in with your Google account.
4. Once you're in the game, choose the play for the next at bat under "Predict Play".
5. You have 10 seconds to make your selection. Choose one of the options: "hit", "out", or "other", and one of their respective sub-options. Note that just selecting the main option without a sub-option will not submit your pick.

## Scoring

As you can see next to each option under "Predict Play", you will be rewarded points for choosing correctly. For example, if you choose "hit (+25)" -> "single (+40)" and the play result is a single, you will earn 25 + 40 = 65 points. You can track your score under "My Score" and see the top 5 current users for each game.

## Live Data

The live data section fetches updates every 10 seconds from the unofficial MLB.com API. Please note that there might be occasional outages or mistakes due to the data source. Rest assured, the same data is used to calculate scores.

## Recommendations

If you have any recommendations or encounter any issues while using the app, please submit them to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wsuppiger/mlb-predict/issues).
